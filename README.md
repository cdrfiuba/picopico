A very small chiptune synthesizer and player.  Sound is made with an 8-bit microcontroller (Attiny85) and
tries to mimic a classical sound chip used in video game consoles from the 80s.

Pretty much inspired by [1-bit symphony](http://www.1bitsymphony.com/) by
Tristan Perich and [lft/kryo's project](http://www.linusakesson.net/hardware/chiptune.php).

## Hardware

* AVR ATtiny85
* CR2032 coin cell battery
* 1K resistor
* 0.1uf capacitor
* 3.5mm audio jack
* Push button

### Schematic

Note: This schematic is old and inaccurate (although similar). Please see this [tutorial](https://github.com/munshkr/picopico/wiki/Programming-with-Arduino-Uno) as the protoboard picture reflects more accurately the current design.
